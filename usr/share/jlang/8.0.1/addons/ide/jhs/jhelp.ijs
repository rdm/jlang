<a name="jhs"><h1>JHS (J HTTP Server)</h1></a>
JHS is a browser interface to J and
is an alternative to a more traditional desktop application
front end. JHS gives you interactive access to J, an IDE, and
a framework for developing and delivering web applications.
<br><br>

JHS is the J engine running as a console task configured with
scripts to run as an HTTP server. A browser gets pages
from JHS.<br><br>

In default configuration, JHS is similar to a
desktop application. It runs on your desktop and
services local requests from your browser.
It can be configured to provide services to browsers
across a local area network or across the web.<br><br>

JHS is a departure from previous desktop application
front ends and is somewhat experimental.
One issue that arises is whether the JHS IDE should
be as much like a desktop frontend as possible or
whether it should be as much like a browser app as
possible.<br><br>

JHS leans strongly towards being a browser app. You may miss
some desktop features and it may take a while to be comfortable
with the browser approach. With a bit a patience and the
adoption of powerful browser paradigms the result might
please. One advantage of this is that developing new browser
apps from a browser app helps focus the mind.<br><br>

JHS reinvents the wheel in the sense that it doesn't make
use of any of the excellent javascript toolkits for browser
applications. This was partly for the fun of it and partly
because it seemed possible to do so in a lean and effective way.
The JHS javascript library is tiny compared to kits like
jquery.js and ext.js. Hopefully this makes it easier to learn
and use for those who aren't proficient javascript programmers.
There was also a feeling that these toolkits have
largely been developed to deal with complex issues of browser
incompatibilies in older browsers. By insisting on
modern browsers JHS avoids many of these issues. And looking
a bit forward to html5 much of the nice packaging of 
services in these toolkits will come for free. And if
appropriate, it is easy to include any additional toolkit
with the JHS framework and have the best of all worlds
in developing your browser app.
 
<a name="ide"><h1>IDE (Interactive Development Environment)</h1></a>
<span class="h">target</span><br>
New pages target _blank (new tab but may depend on browser).
Change TARGET_jhs_ to be _self (and refresh) to have pages open in place.

<br><br><span class="h">keyboard shortcuts</span><br>
esc key escapes next key to be a shortcut.<br/>
For example, esc j links to jijx page.<br/>
Menu items document shortcuts on the right.<br/>
esc 1 sets focus on menu.<br/>
esc 2 sets focus to page default.<br/>
<br/>
Control shortcuts are supported for ,./<>? as they
less likely conflict with the browser.<br/><br/>

jijx ctrl+. is lab advance.<br/><br/>

Example of a custom jijx handler:
<pre>   ev_comma_ctrl_jijx_=: 3 : 'i.5'</pre>

Other pages require J and Javascript handlers. For example,
<pre>
ev_comma_ctrl=: 3 : 'i.5'
function ev_comma_ctrl(){jdoajax([]);}
</pre>

<span class="h">jijx</span>
Run J sentences (ctrl+shift+&uarr;&darr; recall)

<br><br><span class="h">jijxh</span>
iPhone/iTouch/iPad (and similar) support.

<br><br><span class="h">jijxm</span>
Simple browser support that requires only basic html.
jijx and related pages require advanced browser features
(javascript, style sheets, contenteditable divs, ajax, ...).

<br><br><span class="h">jijxipad</span>
iPad and similar support.

<br><br><span class="h">jfile</span>
Browse files for editing, etc.
Adequate for simple IDE use and for a remote server.
For more complicated requirements use host facilities such
as Windows Explorer or Mac Finder.

<br><br><span class="h">jijs</span>
CodeMirror (www.codemirror.net) editor. See menu action|search/ctrl for ctrl/search/replace info.
<a href="#codemirror">CodeMirror Copyright</a>

<br><br><span class="h">jijsta</span>

</pre>

<span class="h">jijx action menu</span>
A script defines action menu items and the verbs to run
when clicked. Shortcuts wqe are hardwired to the first
3 added menu items. The following is a sample file you can
define and then modify:
<pre class="jcode">
*** script ~user/projects/ja/ja.ijs ***
coclass'z'
ja_menu=: 0 : 0
aaa
bbb
<PAREN>

ja_aaa=: 3 : 0
'aaa clicked'
<PAREN>

ja_bbb=: 3 : 0
'bbb clicked'
<PAREN>
***
</pre>

<span class="h">jijx debug menu</span>
With debug on (jijx menu debug), execution suspends at an error or a stop.
<pre class="jcode">
   dbsm'name'      - display numbered definition lines
   dbsm'name ...'  - add stops
   dbsm'name :...' - add dyadic stops
   dbsm'~...'      - remove stops starting with ...
   dbsm''          - display stops
</pre>

Try the following:
<pre class="jcode">
   dbsm'calendar'   NB. numbered explicit defn
   dbsm'calendar 0' NB. stop monadic line 0
menu debug|on
   calendar 1
study stack display - note 6 blank prompt

Windows gnuplot install:<br>
Follow <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">www.gnuplot.info</a> download links, download gp444win32.zip, and unzip in your home folder.<br><br>

Linux gnuplot install:<br>
Modern linux distributions can install gnuplot with (or equivalent):
<pre class="jcode">
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
</pre>

Mac gnuplot install:<br>
You need to build libgd and gnuplot binaries and associated files from source.
Google <b>installing gnuplot on mac brainlog</b> 
for one of the better descriptions. 
The following is a simplified set of steps.<br><br>

Xcode developer tools are required to build from source. Install Xcode from the OSX distribution dvd or from the net.<br><br>

Build libgd first so that gnuplot build will include png output.<br><br>

libgd build:<br>
Download gd-2.0.35.tar.gz. From code.google.com search for the file and download the one dated Dec 27,2007.

<pre class="jcode">
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xf gd-2.0.35.tar 
cd ~/Downloads/gd/2.0.35
sudo ln -s /usr/X11R6/include/fontconfig /usr/local/include
ln -s `which glibtool` ./libtool
./configure --with-png=/usr/X11 --x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib
sudo make clean
sudo make
sudo make install
</pre>

gnuplot build:<br>
Download gnuplot-4.4.4.tar.gz. From www.gnuplot.info follow links to download from SourceForge.

<pre class="jcode">
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xf gnuplot-4.4.4.tar 
cd ~/Downloads/gnuplot-4.4.4
./configure

<a name="sp"><h1>Simple Project</h1>

Noun sphelp has information on Simple Project utilities.<br><br>

<a name="gui"><h1>GUI</h1>

GUI applications are built with J, JHS framework, html,
javascript, and css.

See jijx demos for examples of GUI applications.<br><br>

The IDE is built with the same facilities. See
~addons/ide/jhs/jfile.ijs to see how the jfile page is
implemented.<br><br>

You can create simple applications with just info
from the demos. For more complicated applications you
need to learn about html, DOM (document object model),
javascript, and css (styles).<br><br>

There are great web resources on these topics.
You may prefer more structured
presentation and there are many books to choose from. None
stand out, but 'The Definitive Guide' series from O'Reilly
on HTML, Javascript, and CSS are adequate.<br><br>

There is a lot to learn to cover everything. Fortunately
the learning curve, though long, is not terribly steep
and there are significant rewards along the way.
Everything you learn is applicable not just to J,
but to every aspect of the incredible world of web programming.

<a name="jum"><h1>JUM (J User Manager)</h1>
JUM is a JHS application that runs on a web server
that provides JHS servers to J users. JUM users share
a single user account on the server and your files are
accessible to other users.<br><br>

To provide a JUM service you install J on a web server
and run the JHS JUM application. Users can access the JUM
web page and can manage their own JHS server.
The JUM sevice should be provided in a secure environment.
In a Linux server this is done with a jail account.
<br><br>
Study script ~addons/ide/jhs/jum.ijs to learn how to run your own JUM service.
A rough sketch of the steps are:
<pre class="jcode">
   start jconsole task
   load'~addons/ide/jhs/core.ijs'
   load'~addons/ide/jhs/jum.ijs'
   createjum_jum_ 65002;'1234' NB. only if new PORT or PASS
   init_jhs_'jum'
   browse to jum task /jijx and login 
   startjum_jum_ 65003 65004 65005;'localhost';'buzz'
   browse to jum task /jum and create new account
</pre>

<a name="config"><h1>Config</h1>
For info on changing JHS config see file: <CONFIG>

<a name="console"><h1>Console</h1>
The JHS jconsole window diplays useful information.
It can kill the JHS task in the event of problems.
In windows you can edit the icon properties to run minimized.
You can hide the window if you wish:
<pre class="jcode">   jshowconsole_j_ 0 NB. hide/show 0/1</pre>
